# Snake Study Project 🐍

## Description
This is a personal learning project inspired by the classic Snake game.  
The goal is to practice front-end development, JavaScript logic, and team collaboration by recreating the core mechanics: player movement, collision detection, scoring, and game-over conditions.  

This project was done in a learning context and is not intended to be a commercial version.
